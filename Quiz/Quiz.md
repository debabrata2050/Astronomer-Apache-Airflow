## Airflow: UI

#### 1. What's the best view to use to visualize your assets?  
- [x] Asset View âœ…  
- [ ] DAGs View
- [ ] Graph View

#### 2. What's the best view to check the historical states of the DAG Runs and Task Instances for a given DAG?
- [x] Grid View âœ…
- [ ] Graph View
- [ ] DAGs View

#### 3. What's the best view to get overall metrics of your Airflow instance?
- [x] The Home View âœ…
- [ ] Code View
- [ ] Asset View

#### 4. What's the best view to know if code updates have been applied?
- [ ] Home View
- [x] Code View âœ…  
- [ ] Graph View

#### 5. What does the last column on the DAG View show?
- [x] DAG run states of current and previous DAG Runs for a given DAG âœ…  
- [ ] Task's states of the current or latest DAG Run for a given DAG

## Airflow: DAGs 101

#### 1. What's the role of the start date?
- [x] Define when the DAG starts being scheduled âœ…
- [ ] Define the trigger interval
- [ ] Avoid running past non-triggered DAG Runs

#### 2. What happens if you don't define a start date?
- [x] Nothing, it's optional âœ…
- [ ] That raises an error

#### 3. What's the role of tags?
- [x] The allow to better organizing DAGs âœ…
- [x] They allow filtering DAGs âœ…
- [ ] They prevent from running DAGs that do not belong to the current user
 
#### 4. How can you avoid assigning the dag object to every task you create?
- [x] with DAG(...) âœ…
- [ ] dag = ...
- [x] @dag(..) âœ…
- [ ] You can't. You must assign the dag object to every task

#### 5. What happens when two DAGs share the same DAG id?
- [ ] The two DAGs appear on the UI
- [ ] You get an error
- [x] One DAG randomly shows up on the UI âœ…
 
#### 6. Does `task_a >> task_b >> task_c` is equivalent to `task_c << task_b << task_a?`
- [x] Yes âœ…
- [ ] No

## Airflow: DAG Scheduling

#### 1. If a DAG runs every day at midnight with a `start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1)`, when will the 3rd DAG run be triggered?
- [ ] 2025-01-01 00:00
- [ ] 2025-01-02 00:00
- [x] 2025-01-03 00:00 âœ…
- [ ] 2025-01-04 00:00

#### 2. If a DAG with a "@daily" schedule is triggered at 00:00 on 2025-02-02, what's the logical date value for this DAG Run?
- [x] 2025-02-01 00:00 âœ…
- [ ] 2025-02-02 00:00
- [ ] 2025-02-03 00:00

#### 3. If a DAG with a "@daily" schedule is triggered at 00:00 on 2025-02-02, what's the `data_interval_end` value for this DAG Run (assuming data intervals are used)?
- [ ] 2025-02-01
- [x] 2025-02-02 âœ…
- [ ] 2025-02-03
- [ ] 2025-02-04

#### 4. With `catchup=False`, what happens when you run your DAG for the first time, and it has a `start_date` defined as 30 days ago?
- [ ] Nothing
- [x] The latest non-triggered DAG Run is triggered âœ…
- [ ] All non-triggered DAG Runs get triggered

#### 5. `logical_date = data_interval_start = data_interval_end` by default?
- [ ] Yes
- [x] No âœ…
