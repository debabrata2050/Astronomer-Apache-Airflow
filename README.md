# Apache Airflow 101 ‚òÅÔ∏è  

![Last_Update : 09 2025](https://img.shields.io/badge/Last_Update-09--2025-brightgreen)

Welcome to the repository containing **quiz questions and notes** for Apache Airflow, inspired by the Airflow 101 learning path from Astronomer! üöÄ  
This repo helps you build foundational knowledge of Airflow 3 by consolidating key concepts, quizzes, and notes covering core topics like DAG creation, scheduling, the Airflow UI, XComs, sensors, and more.

## üìö About Airflow 101 Learning Path  
The Airflow 101 learning path guides you through the essential skills to get started with Apache Airflow 3, including:
- Core Airflow concepts and architecture  
- Navigating and using the Airflow UI  
- Building your first DAG following best practices  
- Efficiently scheduling DAGs  
- Managing data pipelines and tasks
